Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
ðŸ©º Project Overview
This project is focused on predicting the presence of heart disease using machine learning algorithms. The aim is to build a predictive model that can help healthcare professionals identify patients at risk of heart disease. The dataset used for this project contains various health parameters, such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, etc., which are used to predict the likelihood of heart disease.

ðŸ“Š Algorithms Used
The following machine learning algorithms were implemented in this project:

K-Neighbors Classifier (KNN)
Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest Classifier
Each algorithm was evaluated to determine the best model based on accuracy and performance metrics.
